# Visualizing Les Misérables Characters with Gephi

This project consists of visualizing the characters of the novel Les Misérables using the Gephi software. Gephi is an open-source software for visualizing and exploring large-scale networks and graphs. In this project, we used Gephi to create a network graph that shows the relationships between the characters in Les Misérables.

## Visualization

Visualization is the process of representing data or information graphically, in a way that makes it easier to understand and analyze. Visualizations can help to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be apparent from raw data. In this project, we used visualization to gain insights into the complex network of relationships between the characters in Les Misérables.

## Importance of Visualization

Visualization is an important tool for data analysis and decision-making in many fields, including science, engineering, business, and the arts. It allows us to see patterns and relationships that might not be apparent in other forms of data representation, and to explore and analyze data in an interactive and intuitive way.

By visualizing the characters of Les Misérables, we can gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between the characters, their interactions and dependencies, and the overall structure of the story. This can help us to appreciate the complexity and richness of the novel, and to explore new avenues for interpretation and analysis.

## In this repository

In this repository, you will find:

- cartographie_gephi.pdf: a report detailing the steps we took to create the visualization, including screen shots of the process.

- miserables.gefx: the Gephi project file that contains all the data and configuration for the visualization.

- miserables.gephi: the output of the visualization in Gephi's native file format.

To view the visualization, you will need to have Gephi installed on your computer. You can then open the miserables.gefx file in Gephi to see the visualization and explore it further.
