# Visual network analysis with Gephi

This project consists of visualizing the characters of the novel Les Mis√©rables using the Gephi software!

In this repository, you will find:

- cartographie_gephi.pdf: a report detailing the steps we took to create the visualization, including screen shots of the process.

- miserables.gefx: the Gephi project file that contains all the data and configuration for the visualization.

- miserables.gephi: the output of the visualization in Gephi's native file format.

To view the visualization, you will need to have Gephi installed on your computer. You can then open the miserables.gefx file in Gephi to see the visualization and explore it further.
